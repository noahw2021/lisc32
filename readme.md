# lisc32
LISC32 is a 32-bit RISC architecture designed for simplicity and functionality.

## Documentation
Autogenerated instruction documentation is available [here](isn_docs.md).

### System Configuration
The default state is to load a 16 MiB physical address space from 
`0x00000000` to `0x00FFFFFF`. The BIOS is expected to be at `0x0200`
and should be `0x1000` bytes long, until `0x1200`.
